Included here are polar-gridded d18O with 12.5 km resolution computed using the linear relationship between d18O and Salinity. 
Global gridded d18O were also produced with .25 deg resolution.

Salinity data used are satellite-derived sea surface salinity (SSS) from Aquarius-SAC/D. 
SSS dataset gridded in the polar stereographic projection are available here: 
https://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=482 
d18O data used are from the GISS Global seawater Oxygen-18 database: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/o18data/

Also attached are the IDL codes to create the gif files from the attached dat.gz files as well as 
the sector maps used to compute the d18O values.
