Polar-gridded d18O with 12.5 km resolution using the linear relationship between d18O and Salinity. 
Salinity data used are satellite-derived sea surface salinity (SSS) from Aquarius-SAC/D. 
d18O data used are from the GISS Global seawater Oxygen-18 database: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/o18data/
SSS dataset gridded in the polar stereographic projection are available here: 
https://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=482 
Global gridded d18O are produced with .25 deg resolution.

Also included here are the IDL codes used to create the gif files from the attached dat.gz files and the sector maps used.
